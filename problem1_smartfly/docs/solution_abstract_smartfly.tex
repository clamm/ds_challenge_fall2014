Explain your methodology including approach, assumptions, software and algorithms used, testing and validation techniques applied, model selection criteria, and total time spent.

\subsection{Approach}

\subsubsection{Get to know the data}

As first step I do a basic structure and content analysis of the given data files on the command line in order to prepare loading the data into any tool/program in the following. More specifically I do a line count of the files and a unique count if entries per field.

As second step I do an exploratory data analysis on the historic as well as the prediction data set. I analyse both sets to avoid potential issues arising when the prediction data is largely different in structure or content from the historic data that will be used for training a model. 

I use the open source statistics software R\footnote{\url{http://www.r-project.org/}} the exploratory data analysis since it has all necessary analysis functions and plotting tools already implemented.
